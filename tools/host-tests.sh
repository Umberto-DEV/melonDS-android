# Android/JNI/melonDS dependencies on purpose, so they can be built and run with a plain
# host compiler -- no NDK, no emulator, no device.
#
# It then runs the core-dependent tests under tools/host-tests/jit/, which do link the
# emulator core and so need it built for the host first (see tools/core-host-sanitize.sh).
# Those are skipped, not failed, when the core cannot be built here.
#
# Usage: tools/host-tests.sh
# Exit code: 0 if every test built and passed, non-zero otherwise.
